// This file is intentionally kept as a small comment so the C# project
// in this workspace doesn't attempt to compile Arduino C/C++ code.

// The real Arduino sketch is available as `Arduino0929.ino` in the same
// folder. Open that file in the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO to build and
// upload to your board.

/* Notes:
 - If you want this file to be a C# wrapper or utility, rename it and
	 implement proper C# code. For now it's a placeholder comment.
